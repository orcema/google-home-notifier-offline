This is a fork of the google-home-notifier-library:

**important:**<br>
**offline** refers to the announcement text being played from a local folder, but you still need an internet connection for casting to your google device, this i due to the google casting architecture.

**version 1.0.1:**
fix: url to play from localserver

**version 1.0.0:**
reading speed is now supported with the function "setSpeechSpeed"

**version 0.0.6:**
**fix:** when casting to multiple devices, restoring devices inital volume level didn't work, thus all the devices remained at the announcement volume level.
